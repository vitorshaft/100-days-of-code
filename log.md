# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added Serial Reading to get motor rotation info and angular position differential control to handle latency.

**Thoughts:** Nice to finally write down the idea I had last night to the problem I found this week testing Raspberry Pi Mobile Robot (RMR). I have to test its performance before proceed to next step of this project.

### Day 2: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Changed pair emitter/receiver of my lasertag robot project: "Kabuto 2". The code now uses interrupt and I also changed bluetooth communication pins to avoid conflict to USB communication pins (0 and 1) during code upload to Arduino.

**Thoughts:** I ask my self how did I procrastinated so long to solve this issue on Kabuto 2. It was thankful to see how I have grown because it was simple to code and solve an old problem (from 2 years ago) with some experience acquired during this time.
