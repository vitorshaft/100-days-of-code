# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added Serial Reading to get motor rotation info and angular position differential control to handle latency.

**Thoughts:** Nice to finally write down the idea I had last night to the problem I found this week testing Raspberry Pi Mobile Robot (RMR). I have to test its performance before proceed to next step of this project.
